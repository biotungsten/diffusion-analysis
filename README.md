# diffusion-analysis
This repository contains the code used to analyze the data (prevalently imagery data) of our diffusion measurements.

## Overall structure

In the `src` directory the source code is contained.

The `pictures` directory contains all imagery data collected. Inside this directory the folders are named by the diltuion (folder x contains pictures of dilution 1:x). Herein one can find multiple pictures for each dilution. The images with `copy` in the filename are pictures of the respective control.

The `figures` directory contains all figures, generated during the analysis of the data.
