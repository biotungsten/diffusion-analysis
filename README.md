This repository contains the code used to analyze the data (prevalently imagery data) of our diffusion measurements.

## Overall structure

In the `src` directory the source code is contained. The `pictures` directory contains all imagery data collected. The `figures` directory contains all figures, generated during the analysis of the data.
